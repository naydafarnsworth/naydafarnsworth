I am an undergraduate student at Colgate University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My relevant coursework includes Calculus I-III, Combinatorics, Computational Mathematics, Computer Systems, Data Structures & Algorithms, Differential Equations, Discrete Structures, Geographics Information Systems, Linear Algebra, and Numrical Analysis. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently working with Dr. Gabriel Sosa Castillo on a project in mathematics regarding monomial orders. I have recently concluded an the NSF Funded Centeer for Equitable Energy Transition (CEET) REU where I worked in the Emerging Embedded Technologies Lab researching bias in federated learning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My professional interests include gaining more breadth in terms of research direction, strengthening my mathematical and computational literacy, building engaging and appealing UI systems, and working with algebraic software systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I am not studying, I enjoy all things outdoors, including snowboarding, surfing, hiking, rock climbing, and running. I often spend time cooking and trying new foods with friends, and appreciate the company of friendly felines.
